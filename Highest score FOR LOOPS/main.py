This part of the code is where you will write your solution to find the highest score in the list of student scores.

First, you initialize a variable highest_score to 0. This will be used to keep track of the highest score seen so far.

Then, you use a for loop to iterate through each score in student_scores. For each score, you check if it is greater than the current highest_score. If it is, then you update the highest_score variable to be equal to the score.

Finally, you print out the highest_score using an f-string to format the output message. This will display the highest score in the list of student scores.
